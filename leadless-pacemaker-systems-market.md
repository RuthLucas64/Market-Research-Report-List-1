<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Leadless Pacemaker Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Chambered Systems</li><li>Double-Chambered Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Leadless pacemaker systems are innovative devices that manage heart rhythms without traditional leads. Single-chambered systems utilize a single lead to stimulate either the right atrium or ventricle, suitable for patients requiring basic pacing. In contrast, double-chambered systems coordinate pacing between both the atrium and ventricle, ensuring more synchronized heart activity. This dual approach is beneficial for patients with more complex arrhythmias, enhancing overall cardiac function and improving patient outcomes while reducing complications associated with leads.</p></p>
