<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Security CMOS Image Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>FSI</li><li>BSI</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Security CMOS Image Sensor market is primarily categorized into two types: Front-Side Illuminated (FSI) and Back-Side Illuminated (BSI) sensors. FSI sensors capture light from the front, making them less sensitive in low-light conditions, but they are more cost-effective. In contrast, BSI sensors allow light to hit the photodiodes directly from the back, enhancing sensitivity and performance in low light, making them ideal for surveillance applications. These advancements drive demand in security-related technologies.</p></p>
