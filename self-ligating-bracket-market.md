<p><p>Self-ligating brackets are a type of dental bracket used in orthodontics that do not require elastics or ligatures to hold the archwire in place. Instead, they utilize a built-in mechanism that allows the wire to slide within the bracket, reducing friction and enabling more efficient tooth movement. The advantages of self-ligating brackets include shorter appointment times, less discomfort for patients, and improved oral hygiene due to the absence of rubber bands that can trap plaque.</p><p>The market for self-ligating brackets is experiencing significant growth, driven by increasing consumer awareness about orthodontic treatments and the rising prevalence of malocclusion and dental aesthetic concerns. The Self-Ligating Bracket Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 7.7% during the forecast period.
